    <h1> Emily's Blur Image</h1>
    <img src="blurred.jpg" alt ="This time is blurry." /> 
    <p> I chose this image because I want to see the differences between my shallow depth of field and photoshop field of blur photos. I chose to blurry everything but my friend and the camera becasue they are main focus and we trying to see the blurry of the background. </p>
